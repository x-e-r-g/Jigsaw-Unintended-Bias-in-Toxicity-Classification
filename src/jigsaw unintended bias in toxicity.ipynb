I think the question of \"bias\" and \"prejudice\" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being \"intolerant\" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of \"irratonal antipathy\" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the \"bias\" question in another response to you....\n",

Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.\n",

Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united. We clearly don't share the same morality from state to state. The truth is all lives don't matter here. They never have. We will never be united until we make all lives matter.\n",
